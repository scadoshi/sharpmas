# Common

Helpers more than one day needs.

Empty on `main` on purpose. Put a type here the second day wants it, not the
first: a helper written for one puzzle is a helper shaped by one puzzle.

What tends to end up here is grid and geometry work, since Advent of Code
returns to it every year. A cartesian point, a grid cell with rows and columns,
a compass direction, a quarter turn.

These are the shared types the testing rule is about. A break here corrupts
every day at once, so anything in this folder earns tests, where a single day's
logic does not: that is what `--validate` is for.

Namespace them `Sharpmas.Domain.Solution.Common`, matching the folder.
